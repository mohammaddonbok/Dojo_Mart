# Definition:
  Following the current with online shopping, we decided to do an e-commerce project for a market where people can shop online for groceries. 
  The website allows visitors to browse all products inside available categories; also, they can add to the cart what they wish to buy in the future.
  For registered users, they can place orders with all items, which were added to the cart by the user.
  For the owner of the shop (who was given the admin role), he/she can add categories and products to the website.
  He/She can browse all placed orders so those orders can be prepared and sent to the buyerâ€™s address.
  
 ### well we can also list all the technologies that were used:
  - Front end: Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX.
  - Back end: Python Django Framework.
  - Data Base: MySQL.
